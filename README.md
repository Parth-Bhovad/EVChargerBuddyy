# Everything you need to know about this Project :

There are lots of EV users but very less EV charging stations. But all EV users have the charging facility. So, what if all EV users became EV charging stations? This is not happening because everyone feels that going to someone home to charge their EV is very awkward.  And this awkward ness is because people feel like this is a Parasitims Relationship. So, we are taking an initiative to make this parasitism relationship to mutualism relationship where:

- **Hosts** can offer their private charging point to nearby drivers and earn a small fee.
- **Guests** can quickly find and pay for charging nearby when they’re stuck.
